This Rust-based project leverages the Hyper HTTP library to create a high-performance web server designed explicitly for handling API requests in video streaming applications. By focusing on concurrency and low-latency operations, the server efficiently manages video data transmission, ensuring a seamless streaming experience. The core of this project is to provide developers with a robust infrastructure capable of supporting the demanding requirements of modern video streaming services, including high concurrent user access and rapid data processing. With an emphasis on optimization and leveraging Rust's inherent safety and speed, this server stands as a foundational component for building scalable, efficient video streaming platforms.
